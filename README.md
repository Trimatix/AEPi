<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

**Abyss Engine** is an internal-only game engine developed by Deep Silver FishLabs, for the development of the Galaxy on Fire game series.

The engine uses a proprietary file format for grids of images, called Abyss Engine Image (AEI). The image compression is platform dependant, for example Android texture files are compressed with [Ericsson Texture Compression (ETC)](https://github.com/Ericsson/ETCPACK).

The AEI format was analysed by the Russian modding group 'CatLabs', who later created a GUI and command-line tool for conversion between PNG and AEI, named AEIEditor.

This tool was closed-source, and relied on a windows DLL for compression. AEPi is a minimal recreation of the image conversion logic provided by AEIEditor, leaning on open source image codecs:
- [K0lb3/etcpak](https://github.com/K0lb3/etcpak)
- [K0lb3/tex2img](https://github.com/K0lb3/tex2img)

See <a href="#roadmap">the project roadmap</a> for currently supported and upcoming features.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

* python 3.11+ is required, as this project uses structural pattern matching.

### Installation

install AEPi from PyPi:
```
python -m pip install aepi
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
### Usage

This library reflects the real representation of an AEI file on disk; though textures are added to and read from an AEI object as individual images, the underlying representation is a single image. This improves encoding/decoding performance, and enables overlapping textures.

For maximum flexibility, AEPi returns AEIs as BytesIO objects.

The recommended best practise is to wrap your AEPi call in a `with` statement, to ensure that all of the AEI's images are cleaned out of memory when it goes out of scope.

#### Open an .aei file on disk

```py
from AEPi import AEI

with AEI.read("path/to/file.aei") as aei:
  print(
    f"The AEI is compressed in {aei.format.name} format, "
    f"with {len(aei.textures)} textures. "
    f"Width: {aei.shape[0]} Height: {aei.shape[0]}"
)
```

##### Reading textures as image segments

`AEI.textures` provides read access to all of the AEI's bounding boxes. The `AEI.getTexture` method returns the relevant segment of the AEI, as a Pillow `Image`.

Using this, you could for example, batch export all of the individual images within an AEI:

```py
for i, tex in enumerate(aei.textures):
  with aei.getTexture(tex) as im:
    im.save(f"batch/export/{i}.png")
```

#### Create a new AEI

```py
from AEPi import AEI, CompressionFormat,
from PIL import Image

image_path = "ship-texture.png"
image2_path = "another-texture.png"

# create a new .aei file
with Image.open(image_path) as image, Image.open(image2_path) as image2:
  # Images are always assumed to be RGB(A). AEPi handles channel swapping for ETC to BGR(A)
  with AEI(image) as new_aei:
    # 'textures' - image bounding boxes
    new_aei.addTexture(image2, 0, 0)
    # The below operation is legal, but would leave unused image content in the AEI!
    new_aei.removeTexture(0, 0, image2.width, image2.height, clearImage=False)
```

#### Write a new AEI file to disk

```py
    with open("path/to/newFile.aei", "wb") as new_file:
      # compression format can be specified at write time, or in the constructor
      aei.write(new_file, format=CompressionFormat.DXT5)
```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

The AEPi 1.0 release will mark feature parity with AEIEditor, which theoretically reflects all of the capabilities required to manipulate Galaxy on Fire 2 AEIs on all platforms.

For details of the work that needs to be done, see the issues listed under the 1.0 milestone: https://github.com/Trimatix/AEPi/milestones

Other work is needed (e.g documentation, QOL improvements...), but below is an overview of the *features* implementation progress towards AEIEditor parity:

|Feature                    |Read support|Write support |
|---------------------------|:----------:|:------------:|
|Raw image content          |     ✅     |      ✅      |
|Basic metadata             |     ✅     |      ✅      |
|Texture regions            |     ✅     |      ✅      |
|Mipmapping                 |     ✅     |      ❌      |
|Compression quality (l/m/h)|     ❌     |      ❌      |
|Symbol maps                |     ❌     |      ❌      |

And compression format support progress:

|Format                 |Read support|Write support |
|-----------------------|:----------:|:------------:|
|Uncompressed           |     ❌     |      ❌      |
|Uncompressed_UI        |     ✅     |      ✅      |
|Uncompressed_CubeMap_PC|     ✅     |      ✅      |
|Uncompressed_CubeMap   |     ✅     |      ✅      |
|PVRTC12A               |     ❌     |      ❌      |
|PVRTC14A               |     ❌     |      ❌      |
|ATC                    |     ✅     |      ❌      |
|DXT1                   |     ✅     |      ❌      |
|DXT3                   |     ❌     |      ❌      |
|DXT5                   |     ✅     |      ✅      |
|ETC1                   |     ✅     |      ✅      |

Extra feature requests for after the 1.0 release are very welcome.
